# strange IDE compile problem 
IDE has an highligting bug when looking at the test class test idea will report some problems (a method not implemented).

For my real project right click and run will cause a lot of compile issues. For this project, it will result in a runtime error.

What is strange though, on the CLI everything is working just fine. i.e. an sbt test will complete successfully with all tests passing.
